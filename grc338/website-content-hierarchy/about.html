         <h1>Our story</h1>
         <p> After raving about his wife's sandwiches and homemade coffee, Grandpa Krieg knew he had to share those recipes. He wanted to create a welcoming, homey environment for friends and family to enjoy each other's company and Grandma Krieg's cooking. Krieg's Cafe was born in a small town in Michigan, USA and opened it's doors in 1960. Once word got around, more friends flooded in and the cafe became a popular hang out place at all open hours. Since then, the younger generations of Kriegs have helped expand the business without losing any of the original charm. </p>
         <p>Welcome friends, we're happy to have you.</p>

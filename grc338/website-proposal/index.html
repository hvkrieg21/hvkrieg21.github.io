            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>The Cozy Corner</p>
            
            <p>Welcome to The Cozy Corner, a bookstore in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts. We are a quiet, comfy place to escape amidst the big city rush. On one hand, we are a traditional bookstore, but on the other hand, we offer quiet rooms to reserve for reading and studying equipped with desks and comfortable lounging furniture.  </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target market is young adults, aged 18-36, who enjoy reading books and want a quiet place to read. They are either in college or working so they also want a quiet place to study or do work. </p>
           
            <p>Their tasks and goals with this website are to look through the list of books and gifts we offer, buy books and gifts online, reserve a time slot for the quiet rooms, and check our hours and location.  </p>
